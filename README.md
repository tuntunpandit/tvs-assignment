### functionality Required
The application should have a total of 3 screens.

1. **Login page** – should take an input (username and password) from the user.
2. **list page** – on successful login the user should be redirected to this page, where you need to display the data that is returned by the below REST API.
3. **Details page** – on click of a list item the app should navigate to a new page which displays the details of the data that the row contains. On this page add a button to capture a photo using the phone camera.
**Photo Result page** – once the user clicks the photo, please show this page with the image that the user captured, with the timestamp when the photo was captured on the image

#### To showcase your creativity please think of representing the data using various charts/graphs or on a map. For eg.

1. **Bar Graph** – Have a button on the list page which opens a new screen. The new screen should have a Bar graph with the salaries of the first ten employees plotted on it.
2. **Map** – Represent the various cities in the response data on a map.
